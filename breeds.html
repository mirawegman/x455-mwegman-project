          <div class="text">Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the 
            German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of noble character and high 
            intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the German Shepherd is 
            truly a dog lover's delight. German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches 
            at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful 
            curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can 
            turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds. There are many reasons why German 
            Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their defining 
            attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands 
            for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved 
            ones. German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, but, the 
            breed standard says, there's a 'certain aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate 
            and indiscriminate friendships.</div>

          <div class="text">The Golden Retriever, an exuberant Scottish gundog of great beauty, stands 
            among America's most popular dog breeds. They are serious workers at hunting and field work, 
            as guides for the blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other competitive events, 
            and have an endearing love of life when not at work. The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular 
            dog of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The 
            broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. 
            In motion, Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers 
            say, with a 'merry action.' The most complete records of the development of the Golden Retriever are included 
            in the record books that were kept from 1835 until about 1890 by the gamekeepers at the Guisachan (pronounced 
            Gooeesicun) estate of Lord Tweedmouth at Inverness-Shire, Scotland. These records were released to public notice 
            in Country Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth's great-nephew, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, historian and sportsman, 
            published material that had been left by his ancestor. They provided factual confirmation to the stories that had 
            been handed down through generations. Goldens are outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please family dogs, and relatively 
            easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life and maintain this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These 
            energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For a breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and 
            fetching are natural pastimes.</div>

          <div class="text">The sweet-faced, lovable Labrador Retriever is America's most popular 
            dog breed. Labs are friendly, outgoing, and high-spirited companions who have more than 
            enough affection to go around for a family looking for a medium-to-large dog. The sturdy,
             well-balanced Labrador Retriever can, depending on the sex, stand from 21.5 to 24.5 inches 
             at the shoulder and weigh between 55 to 80 pounds. The dense, hard coat comes in yellow, black, 
             and a luscious chocolate. The head is wide, the eyes glimmer with kindliness, and the thick, 
             tapering 'otter tail' seems to be forever signaling the breed's innate eagerness. Labs are famously 
             friendly. They are companionable housemates who bond with the whole family, and they socialize well 
             with neighbor dogs and humans alike. But don't mistake his easygoing personality for low energy: 
             The Lab is an enthusiastic athlete that requires lots of exercise, like swimming and marathon games 
             of fetch, to keep physically and mentally fit.</div>
